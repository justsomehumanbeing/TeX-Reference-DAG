draw_graphs.py

An auxiliary python-script to draw directed graphs in LaTeX using TikZ.
- It takes graphs where nodes are tuples of integers (as derived from LaTeX numbering such as 2.1.5) and an integer n and collapses the nodes where the first n numbers are equal but keeps all edges.
This is useful to calculate the dependencies of sections (n=1), or subsections (n=2).
- Takes an arbitrary directed graph and draws it in TikZ.

This script is heavily commented to ensure understandability.
