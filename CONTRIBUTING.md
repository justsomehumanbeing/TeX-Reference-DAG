## 💡 How to Contribute

* Report bugs via GitHub Issues
  or by emailing [linojossfidel.haupt@uni-jena.de](mailto:linojossfidel.haupt@uni-jena.de)
  (please start the subject line with `[TeX-Reference-DAG]`)
* Suggest new features or improvements (via the same channels)
* Submit pull requests (PRs) for bug fixes or enhancements
* For non-technical contributors:

  * Improve the documentation
  * Provide us with nice LaTeX projects (both with consistent and inconsistent ordering) that we can use as test cases.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Style

* Use **Python 3.x** and aim for clarity, efficiency, and readability
* Prefer minimalism and simplicity; use clear variable names and **many meaningful comments**
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies

### 🧬 Multi-language Code

If a new feature is significantly easier to implement in another language (e.g. Lua, Shell, Rust):
✅ Feel free to use it — *as long as interoperability is clean and robust*
❗ Please keep the number of languages to a reasonable minimum.
The same holds for large efficiency gains in another language.

* Write a **clear and informative description** of your changes
* If possible, run tests beforehand.
